Description: GIS-like interaction with shapefiles: zoom in  ESRI shapefile plots, show or change attributes by clicking on them in a plot. Currently only works for Line-shapefiles. Further development from my side is not planned in 2014, as I want to focus on my (soon to be) CRAN package extremeStat.
